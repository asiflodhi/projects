SQL/BI/Database Playground
-------------------------------------------
This is just a collection of SQL (Structured Query Language) scripts in one or more RDBMS (SQL Server, Oracle, Postgresql, Sqlite [well, I know it's a library!], MySQL, MariaDB, etc) and I wish to cover things that interest me in this area. For example, in a recent database project, I was using SQL Server 2008 and needed some functionality that exists SQL Server 2012 and onwards; that led me to write me to develop the functionality myself using standard ISO SQL only (no TSQL).

You're allowed to reuse the code here as long you give me the due credit (as MIT License says).
